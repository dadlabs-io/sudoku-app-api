# CLAUDE.md — sudoku-app-api

Vercel serverless function that turns Sudoku app bug and feature reports into GitHub issues

## What this wiki holds

This is a **unified wiki** — it does both at once (there is no project-type distinction):
- **Research** — external content (articles, papers, videos) ingested + curated via `/wiki-update` (ad-hoc URL) or `/wiki-cycle` (batched discover → ingest → lint → promote). Lands in `research/`.
- **Project knowledge** — your own durable decisions, components, architecture, patterns, and gotchas, captured inline as you work (and via `/wrap-up`). Lands in `project/`.

Both live in the four-layer memory model below.

## Where to look

@C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/README.md
@C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/how-to/llm-wiki/commands.md
@C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/_MAP.md

If the user asks for help (any phrasing — "how do I...", "what commands...", "help"), point them at `llm-wiki/how-to/llm-wiki/` — `commands.md` first, then the skill page under `skills/` that fits their question. You already have these loaded.

## Resuming — where we left off (do this on startup)

Active persona: **api** (`sessions/<persona>/` is per persona; this repo shares the `sudoku-app` notebook with its app repo, so it keeps its own `sessions/api/` and never writes the app's `sessions/main/` files).

After this file and auto-memory load, before the first reply, read in order, each **if present**:
1. `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/sessions/active-context.md` — cross-persona resume pointer
2. `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/sessions/<persona>/handoff.md`, then `task.md` — goal, state, pending; NOW and QUEUE
3. Project status doc, if this project keeps one: (none yet — e.g. `project/roadmap.md`)

If `handoff.md` is missing (no wrap-up yet): read the newest journal under `sessions/<persona>/<YYYY-MM>/` if any, else treat the project as new. Journals otherwise stay on demand.
Open the first reply, whatever the user said, with one paragraph on where we left off and what is next. A project with a Discord bot does its channel catch-up after this read.

Wiki content lives at `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/`, organized into the **four-layer memory model** (icarus integration plan §6). The four layers map 1:1 to classical cognitive memory types:

| Layer | Cognitive analogue | What goes here | Loaded by default? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Working memory** | Working memory (literal) | This conversation — no on-disk location | (always — this is your context) |
| **`sessions/`** | Episodic + working memory | "What happened when I tried X last Thursday" — per-persona session journals, plus the mutable resume dashboards (`active-context.md`, `<persona>/handoff.md`, `<persona>/task.md`) that `/wrap-up` keeps current | ✅ your own persona's folder |
| **`project/`** | Semantic memory (internal) | "What I know about THIS thing we're building" — components, decisions, architecture, patterns, troubleshooting, best-practices | ✅ all of it |
| **`research/`** | Semantic memory (external) | "What I learned from things we ingested" — papers, vendor blogs, library writeups | ❌ only if task explicitly cites it |

Folder structure under `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/`:
- **`sessions/<persona>/YYYY-MM/`** — per-agent episodic log; immutable once written
- **`sessions/active-context.md`**, **`sessions/<persona>/{handoff,task}.md`** — the resume dashboards; overwritten in place by `/wrap-up` Step 0.5, read by the Resuming step above
- **`project/components/`** — modules / classes / systems we've built
- **`project/decisions/`** — ADR-style decisions with the *why* preserved
- **`project/architecture/`** — system-level structural rules
- **`project/patterns/`** — reusable approaches we adopt elsewhere
- **`project/troubleshooting/`** — bugs + root causes (so we don't re-debug)
- **`project/best-practices/`** — project-specific conventions
- **`project/best-practices/framework/`** — meta-framework specs (icarus plan, frontmatter spec, etc.)
- **`research/active/`** — current / evolving external content
- **`research/long-term/`** — peer-reviewed / settled external content
- **`research/tooling/`** — specific tools / libraries / platforms

### Provenance line (project vs research)

Both are semantic memory; the line is **who authored the load-bearing claim**:
- `project/` = "we authored this, it describes us"
- `research/` = "we ingested this, it describes the world"

Synthesis docs that cite research to inform a decision live in `project/` because the load-bearing claim is what *we* decided.

### Where staging + raw live

- `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/research/_inbox/proposed/` — staging area for cycle-ingested entries pending promote-review
- `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/raw/` — immutable raw source files (papers, transcripts) — referenced via `raw_path:` in frontmatter; never edited

## Working rhythm

1. **Start a session**: do the Resuming read above; the MAP is already loaded.
2. **Look it up before answering**: any "what do we know about X", "have we decided X", or "how does X work here" question gets a `/wiki-search "<query>"` FIRST — the wiki, not your memory, is the source of truth. Answering from memory when the wiki holds the answer is the failure mode this whole system exists to prevent.
3. **Code + decide + investigate**: regular dev work. **When you observe something durable — a decision the user makes, a constraint they discover, a pattern you settle on, a bug you trace to root cause — file a proposed entry to `llm-wiki/_inbox/proposed/<folder>/<slug>.md` IMMEDIATELY.** Don't wait for `/wrap-up`. Flag it to the user in one sentence so they know it landed. This is the proactive-listener pattern: the agent is the listener, the wiki is the store.
4. **End of session**: the user runs `/wrap-up` to catch anything the inline filing missed (long sessions, late-emerging patterns).
5. **Promote**: `/wiki-promote --review` to accept/reject the proposed entries — entries go to `wiki/`, backlinks reciprocate, indexes regenerate.

## What counts as "durable" (for inline filing)

File a proposed entry when ANY of these happen:

- **Decision** — user picks an approach over alternatives. Capture the decision, the alternatives considered, and the deciding factor. Folder: `decisions/`.
- **Component built** — non-trivial module/class/script the project will keep. Capture its purpose, public interface, key invariants. Folder: `components/`.
- **Pattern settled** — recurring approach we'll repeat (testing approach, naming convention, error-handling style). Folder: `patterns/`.
- **Bug traced** — root cause + fix that future-you would want to look up. Folder: `troubleshooting/`.
- **Architectural constraint** — something we can't change easily that scopes future work. Folder: `architecture/`.

**Don't file**:
- Speculative ideas the user said "maybe" about
- Ephemeral discoveries that got immediately undone
- Things already in the wiki — search `/wiki-search "<query>"` first if unsure

When in doubt, file it — `/wiki-promote --review` is the gate, so a thin entry costs nothing.

### Entry shape (when filing inline)

Use the same frontmatter contract that `/wrap-up` uses, but stamp `origin: inline` so `/wiki-promote --review` can tell who proposed it. Filing happens to `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/research/_inbox/proposed/<category>/<slug>.md` for new entries:

```yaml
---
title: "<descriptive title>"
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
source_url: "internal://session/<session-id>"
raw_path: "(none — self-authored)"
ingested_by: claude-code
origin: inline       # who filed this: inline | wrap-up | wiki-update
tier: self
confidence: <high|medium|low>
last_reviewed: <YYYY-MM-DD>
review_after: <YYYY-MM-DD+90>
project_type: merged
category: <component|decision|architecture|pattern|troubleshooting>
tags: [<project-slug>, <category>, <topic-tags>]

# Optional icarus truth-status fields (set ONLY if applicable):
# verified: unverified   # default; never set verified='verified' on initial write — use /wiki-verify
# revises: <slug>        # if this revises an older entry
# type: <decision|observation|attempt|rollback|review>
---
```

Project-class entries (decisions, components, etc.) go to `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/project/<category>/`. Use the four-layer rule:
- Filing a NEW project entry directly? → `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/project/<category>/<slug>.md` (skip staging)
- Filing an INGESTED research entry? → `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/research/_inbox/proposed/<slug>.md` (stage for review)
- Filing a SESSION wrap-up? → `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/sessions/<persona>/<YYYY-MM>/<session-id>.md`

Body sections (skip any that don't apply):
1. **TL;DR** — 1-2 sentences
2. **What** — the artifact
3. **Why** — rationale, alternatives, deciding factor
4. **How** — code refs, file paths
5. **Caveats / open questions**
6. **Related** — links to other wiki entries

## Why no agentmemory / no Docker / no API-key burn

We evaluated the rohitg00/agentmemory + iii-engine path 2026-05-14 and concluded: the infrastructure cost (Docker, three "OFF by default" env vars, upstream issues #138/#143/#308/#338, API-key compression burn at ~$5-20/mo) doesn't justify the marginal value over the proactive-listener pattern. The agent (you) is already in the conversation, already capable of judgment, and already has file-write tools. We just told you to use them. See the agentic-design wiki retrospective for the full reasoning.

## Conventions

(Edit this section as the project's conventions emerge — naming, testing, file layout, etc. Start with whatever you currently know; this is the agent's constitution.)

## Common commands

```bash
# Search the project wiki
/wiki-search "<query>"

# Add an external reference (article, doc, video) to the wiki
/wiki-update <url>

# Wrap up the current session
/wrap-up

# Promote what's staged
/wiki-promote --review
```

## Where memory lives (four-layer model)

| Layer | Cognitive analogue | Where | Loaded by default? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Working memory** | Working memory | Claude Code context window | (always) |
| **Sessions** | Episodic + working | C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/sessions/<persona>/YYYY-MM/ (journals) + sessions/active-context.md, sessions/<persona>/{handoff,task}.md (dashboards) | ✅ own persona only |
| **Project** | Semantic (internal — what we built) | C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/project/ | ✅ all |
| **Research** | Semantic (external — what we ingested) | C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/research/ | ❌ on-demand only |
| **Raw** | Immutable substrate | C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/raw/ | (never loaded — referenced via raw_path) |

The four-layer split is load-bearing: it makes "what to load on session start" structurally clear (sessions + project = default, research = on-demand) instead of needing per-persona reading-list curation.

## When guidance conflicts — precedence

Rules for this project live in several places and will occasionally disagree. Do not average them or pick the friendlier one. Apply this order, and say which rule won:

1. **Framework-contract docs** — entries under `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/project/best-practices/framework/` carrying `framework-contract: true` (the frontmatter spec, the authoring principles, the cycle step contract). Canonical. Every other doc is supposed to link to them, never restate them.
2. **Skill definitions** — `SKILL.md` files. A skill that restates a contract doc and drifts is a bug: follow the contract doc, flag the skill.
3. **This CLAUDE.md** and the project's `llm-wiki/how-to/` docs.
4. **Memory and session notes** — `sessions/`, agent memory. Background, never authority.

Mechanical enforcement outranks prose at every level: if a lint check or a script gate rejects something a doc permits, the gate is right until the rule inside the gate is changed. (Added 2026-09-02 after an ingest hit two docs defining `confidence` differently with nothing saying which won.)

## Don't

- Don't answer questions about prior decisions, research, or project history from memory — `/wiki-search` first (Working rhythm step 2).
- Don't paste session transcripts into wiki entries — `/wrap-up` distills them. Transcripts go to `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/raw/sessions/`.
- Don't promote directly to `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/` — always stage in `C:/github.com/project-notebooks/notebooks/sudoku-app/wiki/_inbox/proposed/` and let `/wiki-promote` move them.
- Don't edit `_MAP.md` or `_INDEX.md` by hand — they're auto-generated.
